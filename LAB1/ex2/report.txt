In order to derive these test cases we made sure to draw a control flow graph
for each method that we were testing. For statement coverage we made sure to
test every statement, and for branch coverage we made sure to test all the
branches.

We found a bug in the containsArithTriple method wehere it was possible for
a number to be compared twice, so we changed from j<= i to j<i. This worked
better.
