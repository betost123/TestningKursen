We wrote it on a paper and we donâ€™t understand what you want.

It says that it takes in two sequence parameters a and b. It checks that a and b contains the same amount of copies of elements.

Requires: array.Length > 0 && array has only integers
Ensures: array is sorted && it has the same elements in it as before

4b)
The specification that you wrote in (4a) should use the predicate p. If it doesn't, your contract is under-specified: not all programs that satisfy it are sorting algorithms. In order to illustrate this: take the under-specified contract (the specification in (4a) minus the part that uses the predicate p) and write a simple program that satisfies it. (optionally, write it and verify it in Dafny).
